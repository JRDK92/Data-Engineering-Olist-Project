In order to practice and enhance my data engineeering skillset, I launched a project to model data, create data pipelines, a data lake, and much more. This helped me to further my understanding of Data Engineering both practically and conceptually. For this project, I am using Azure to setup a Data Lake. 

### Objectives of this project:

- Broaden my knowledge of big data infrastructure, data warehousing
- Develop cloud-based data warehouses on modern Cloud Data Warehouse applications: Google BigQuery, Apache Cassandra, Spark, Amazon Redshift, etc.
- Deepen my understanding of big data ecosystems
- Learn how Data Pipelines work in detail


# Part 1: Establishing the Data Warehouses

For this project, I used several completely different applications and cloud data warehouses in order to gain more exposure, and understanding of different CDWs, and how they differ in form and function. These include Apache Cassandra, Snowflake, Azure Data Lake, Google BigQuery, and SQL SERVER.


# Part 2: Modeling the data (ELT)


In all of the applications I used, I first loaded the extracts into the Data Warehouse, and then transformation takes place in the target system. The data was not transformed on submission to the data warehouse, but stored in its original format.
