# SPM Superstore Data Engineering Project üöÄ

As a data professional, I've always been fascinated by building robust data systems from the ground up. This project represents my journey to master modern data engineering while keeping my analytics skills sharp. Using the Olist e-commerce dataset, I'm developing an end-to-end data platform that challenges me to think both as an engineer and analyst. It's a passion project that combines my love for clean data architecture with the thrill of discovering insights through visualization.
