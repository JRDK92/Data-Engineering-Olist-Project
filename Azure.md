### Using Azure

In this project, I made the decision to incorporate Azure in order to diversify my skillset, and gain valuable exposure to Azure. I performed a great deal of research into industry use of tools and applications, and a fair amount of companies appeared to incorporate Azure alongside other major tools, which made me realize that using this in addition to others was vital to my growth as an engineer. 

Goals and Deliverables:

- README file: Describe the data mart columns, the grain of the data mart, and tests to catch any incidental duplication.
- schema.yml file: Include key data for the mart (columns and their descriptions).
- DBT tests that test quality of the data using both SQL and jinja.
- Include a tap, ideally in the main project files.
- Ensure the DBT project structure is sound following DBT's best practices.
